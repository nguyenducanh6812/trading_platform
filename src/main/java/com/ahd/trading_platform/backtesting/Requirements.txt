// Calculate expected minimum records (approximately one per day, with 80% tolerance)
            long expectedRecords = backtestPeriod.getDurationInDays();
            long minimumRequired = (long) (expectedRecords * 0.8);
The logic validate instrument pair should be simple
We have 2 instrument, and the backtest range
So if each instrument have price data in that range then we can response
it pass validation, if not then throw error detail, which instrument not have enough data
what is the ealiest date that instrument have date, so use can adjust date.
